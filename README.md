# ChessAI

I am thrilled to introduce my Chess AI project, which was completed as part of my coursework at school. Using the Arena platform, We implemented both the MinMax and Alpha Beta pruning algorithms to optimize and create an AI capable of challenging players.♟️

I invite you to explore this repository to learn more about the development process and see the final product in action!

➡️ See our [school report](https://github.com/louiselize/ChessAI/blob/main/REPORT_LIZE_AYOUB_CHESS_IA_UQAC.pdf) (in french).

Out of ten teams in our class, our project stood out and we were able to secure second place in the AI competition ! 🏆
